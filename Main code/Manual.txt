****  MANUAL FOR TIME RESOLVED SPECTROSCOPY TOOL  ****

1) Loading a file:
  - LOAD FILE
  - Choose a 2d matrix file, a time-step file and a wavelength file, respectively. Order of choice is important.
  
2) Subtracting a background:
  - Choose number of steps before 0fs to average and subtract from the measurements.
  - Subtract background
  - An averaged background is shown in a separate figure
  
3) Axes limits:
  - Choose the proper time, wavelength and z-axis scales.
  - Figures refresh automatically
  
4) Temporal and spectral dynamics:
  - Write the wavelength (for dynamics) or time in fs (for spectra) and press Plot Cut / Plot Spec
  - Alternative way: Click on 2D - choose wavelength/time by clicking on a 2D plot and pressing enter
  - Alternative way #2: move the slider on the left/top of 2D plot
  - Press Multiple cuts/spectra, Click on 2D multiple times and press enter. Multiple cuts/spectra shows on the figure
  
5) Cutting a matrix:
  - Set the boundary wavelengths for cutting the matrix
  - Press CUT
  - Figures refresh automatically
  
6) Dechirping a matrix:
  - Works best if background subtracted and matrix cut
  - Tighten the z-axis scale to see the chirp clearer
  - Press Chirp correction
  - Choose chirp points by clicking on a chirp on a 2D plot
  - Press enter
  - Polynomial is fit automatically and a new figure with dechirped matrix shows
  - Press Save to save dechirped matrix in a .txt file
  - If not satisfied with chirp correction, press Chirp correction again and repeat steps
