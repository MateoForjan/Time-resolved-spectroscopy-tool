Ultrafast spectroscopy tool can be used to explore ultrafast spectroscopy measurements in great detail. Tool provides the following:

1) Matrix plotting

2) Matrix dechirping
   - Manual choice of points on a chirp (by clicking)
   - fitting a third order polynomial on a chirp
   - dechirping and saving a chirp corrected matrix

3) Time dynamics analysis

4) Spectral dynamics analysis

5) Noise removal by averaging
